I built this Matrix Calculator while tutoring at Golden West College and shared it with my professor as a teaching tool. Inspired by 3Blue1Brownâ€™s visual approach to math, the goal was to help students learn matrix concepts more visually and interactively. Instead of only working through equations on paper, students could experiment with the calculator and immediately see how operations like multiplication or inversion played out step by step.
